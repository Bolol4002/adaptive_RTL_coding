power consumption by appropriate mode selection for varying workload conditions.

	With the increasing demand for energy-efficient computing and portable battery-operated devices, power consumption plays a significant role that dominates system efficiency, thermal management, and operational costs. The control logic architecture can significantly affect the performance of digital circuits that causes power-performance trade-off challenges.
	According to dynamic power equation, when transistors switch frequently in opposite states, the switching activity has more impact on power dissipation that degrades the overall energy efficiency of the system.
	With advanced technology nodes, the leakage current has major impact on static power that shows three major effects on circuit performance (i) increased heat dissipation at chip level due to high switching activity in control logic (ii) reduced battery life due to unnecessary power consumption during idle periods, and (iii) thermal throttling due to excessive dynamic power in performance-critical applications.

	To alleviate these problems, adaptive control logic is a much better approach to reduce the power consumption, switching activity, and timing overhead instead of using fixed control architectures that cannot adapt to varying workload conditions.
	However, the traditional single-mode control units have reached their limit due to inability to optimize for both power and performance simultaneously. Therefore, the researchers are motivated to work on adaptive RTL methodologies using dual-mode control architecture approach to mitigate these problems.
	This proposed work critically addresses the impact of coding style on timing delay, power consumption, and resource utilization, wherein the main attention is to reduce the dynamic power using sequential decoding while maintaining high-speed operation using parallel decoding for a complete control system.
	 In order to reach this goal, adaptive switching is considered innovatively and proposed an accurate RTL architecture for SystemVerilog-based control unit implementation.
Proposed Methodology
	This section provides a detailed understanding of an adaptive RTL based control model using low-power and high-performance architectures.
	An adaptive control model is obtained by integrating dual control paths using the structure shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The low-power unit is implemented using sequential cascaded if-else decoding, and high-performance unit uses parallel one-hot combinational logic. The opcode width (3-bit), control signals, and mode selection
are considered accurately using standard digital design methodology.

	Additionally, the mode signal (mode_i) determines which control path is active where mode=0 selects low-power operation and mode=1 selects high-performance operation.
	The results demonstrate that significant reduction in switching activity for low-power mode w.r.t. high-performance mode as observed from synthesis reports at various opcode combinations.
	An approximate improvement in timing slack is also observed using high-performance mode w.r.t. low-power mode for timing-critical applications, respectively.
Conclusion
	In this paper, an efficient adaptive RTL control unit approach is proposed based on the dual-mode architecture using low-power sequential and high-performance parallel decoding to reduce the impact of unnecessary switching activity, critical path delay, and power dissipation to achieve optimal power-performance trade-off.
	Using the Vivado synthesis setup, the proposed adaptive control model exhibits improved performance in terms of the dynamic power consumption, timing slack, and resource utilization at different operational modes between the control variants.
	It is observed that the proposed low-power control unit outperformed in power efficiency
w.r.t. high-performance control unit due to reduced switching activity in sequential decode path at various opcode combinations.

Similarly, the improvement in timing performance is observed for high-performance control unit w.r.t. low-power variant due to reduced logic depth in parallel decoding architecture for all supported opcodes.
	In addition to that, it is also observed that the high-performance variant consumes more LUT resources as compared to low-power control unit due to parallel comparison logic, respectively. Moreover, the results illustrate significant reduction in critical path delay using high-performance mode w.r.t. low-power mode for timing-critical applications, respectively.
